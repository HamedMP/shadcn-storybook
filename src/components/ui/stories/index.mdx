# shadcn/ui Storybook

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform. This Storybook provides a [component-driven](https://www.componentdriven.org/) development environment for shadcn/ui components.

## About

**This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.**

shadcn/ui is built around several key principles:

- **Open Code:** The component code is open for modification
- **Composition:** Components use a common, composable interface
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Carefully chosen default styles
- **AI-Ready:** Open code for LLMs to read and understand

This Storybook environment adds extra benefits:

- Interactive component previews
- Props documentation and controls
- Component state management
- Visual testing
- Component isolation

## Components

Browse our component collection:

### [All components](/docs/shadcn-ui-components)

## MDX Documentation

This Storybook uses MDX (Markdown + JSX) for rich, interactive documentation. MDX files mix Markdown and JavaScript/JSX to create:

- Readable documentation with Markdown syntax
- Interactive stories with Component Story Format (CSF)
- Embedded JSX component blocks

Each component documentation includes:

- Live examples
- Interactive controls
- API documentation
- Code snippets

## Component Controls

Interact with component props directly:

<Controls of={ButtonStories.Default} />
